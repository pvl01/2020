We made a website called SentEvolution for Hack The Heights 4, a hackathon hosted in Boston College from February 15, 2020 to Februrary 16, 2020. Tasked with the theme, "bridging the gap", our goal was to create a website where users across the nation could collectively produce sentences from wherever their imagination takes them. It'd be akin to a crazy social experiment where, given a starting sentence, there'd be no telling what it'll ultimately end up becoming. A meme, a tragedy, or something that doesn't make sense; we just wanted to see what would happen!

We didn't have any experience with HTML, CSS, or JavaScript, so this was a big challenge. We also didn't have any knowledge of database storage. Despite this, in 24 hours we were able to create a functional website that is able to:

- Support sentences of word lengths five through one
- Contain functional links
- Prompt users to change a word of their choice
- Store data these changes and display every sentence iteration
- Look visually appealing

There's so much more we could do after all this. We could categorize sentences into fun themes (i.e. movies, books, cooking, politics, memes, and more). We also thought about pulling news headlines and turning them into a mad libs (it would've been great if we knew about natural language processing!) We could take care of some existing bugs (e.g. capitalization), make everything work without localStorage and go beyong a local server, make user input "dummy-proof", and so much more...

All things considered, this was a rewarding experience. We learned so much beyond the classroom, and we're really happy that we ended up with a finished product!

We hope you all enjoy it!
